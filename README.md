# Wio Terminal LoRaWAN Field Tester

## What's is it about

When deploying a LoRaWAN network you want to know your gateway coverage and measure the radio performance in different places. When deploying Helium network you particularly want to know how many Hotspot around can be touched for a given position.

There are some existing tools for such application but the cost is about $200. The idea of this project is to propose a simple tool you can build on your own with low cost hardware to fulfill this purpose.

The solution is based on low cost products, easy to find for about $50:

- [RFM95](https://www.disk91.com/2019/technology/lora/hoperf-rfm95-and-arduino-a-low-cost-lorawan-solution/)
